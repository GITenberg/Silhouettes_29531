<p>* The Preface, and the nineteen Poems marked with an asterisk, were not

<a name="1"></a><br>
<br>

<p>PREFACE:</p>

<p>BEING A WORD ON BEHALF OF PATCHOULI.</p>

<p>AN ingenuous reviewer once described some verses of mine as &quot;unwholesome,&quot;
because, he said, they had &quot;a faint smell of Patchouli about them.&quot; I am a
little sorry he chose Patchouli, for that is not a particularly favourite scent
with me. If he had only chosen Peau d'Espagne, which has a subtle meaning, or
Lily of the Valley, with which I have associations! But Patchouli will serve.
Let me ask, then, in republishing, with additions, a collection of little
pieces, many of which have been objected to, at one time or another, as being
somewhat deliberately frivolous, why art should not, if it please, concern
itself with the artificially charming, which, I suppose, is what my critic means
by Patchouli? All art, surely, is a form of artifice, and thus, to the truly
devout mind, condemned already, if not as actively noxious, at all events as
needless. That is a point of view which I quite understand, and its conclusion I
hold to be absolutely logical. I have the utmost respect for the people who
refuse to read a novel, to go to the theatre, or to learn dancing. That is to
have convictions and to live up to them. I understand also the point of view
from which a work of art is tolerated in so far as it is actually militant on
behalf of a religious or a moral idea. But what I fail to understand are those
delicate, invisible degrees by which a distinction is drawn between this form of
art and that; the hesitations, and compromises, and timorous advances, and
shocked retreats, of the Puritan conscience once emancipated, and yet afraid of
liberty. However you may try to convince yourself to the contrary, a work of art
can be judged only from two standpoints: the standpoint from which its art is
measured entirely by its morality, and the standpoint from which its morality is
measured entirely by its art.</p>

<p>Here, for once, in connection with these &quot;Silhouettes,&quot; I have not, if my
recollection serves me, been accused of actual immorality. I am but a fair way
along the &quot;primrose path,&quot; not yet within singeing distance of the &quot;everlasting
bonfire.&quot; In other words, I have not yet written &quot;London Nights,&quot; which, it
appears (I can scarcely realize it, in my innocent abstraction in aesthetical
matters), has no very salutary reputation among the blameless moralists of the
press. I need not, therefore, on this occasion, concern myself with more than
the curious fallacy by which there is supposed to be something inherently wrong
in artistic work which deals frankly and lightly with the very real charm of the
lighter emotions and the more fleeting sensations.</p>

<p>I do not wish to assert that the kind of verse which happened to reflect
certain moods of mine at a certain period of my life, is the best kind of verse
in itself, or is likely to seem to me, in other years, when other moods may have
made me their own, the best kind of verse for my own expression of myself. Nor
do I affect to doubt that the creation of the supreme emotion is a higher form
of art than the reflection of the most exquisite sensation, the evocation of the
most magical impression. I claim only an equal liberty for the rendering of
every mood of that variable and inexplicable and contradictory creature which we
call ourselves, of every aspect under which we are gifted or condemned to
apprehend the beauty and strangeness and curiosity of the visible world.</p>

<p>Patchouli! Well, why not Patchouli? Is there any &quot;reason in nature&quot; why we
should write exclusively about the natural blush, if the delicately acquired
blush of rouge has any attraction for us? Both exist; both, I think, are
charming in their way; and the latter, as a subject, has, at all events, more
novelty. If you prefer your &quot;new-mown hay&quot; in the hayfield, and I, it may be, in
a scent-bottle, why may not my individual caprice be allowed to find expression
as well as yours? Probably I enjoy the hayfield as much as you do; but I enjoy
quite other scents and sensations as well, and I take the former for granted,
and write my poem, for a change, about the latter. There is no necessary
difference in artistic value between a good poem about a flower in the hedge and
a good poem about the scent in a sachet. I am always charmed to read beautiful
poems about nature in the country. Only, personally, I prefer town to country;
and in the town we have to find for ourselves, as best we may, the <i>d<font face=
"Times New Roman">é</font>cor</i> which is the town equivalent of the great
natural <i>d<font face="Times New Roman">é</font>cor</i> of fields and hills.
Here it is that artificiality comes in; and if any one sees no beauty in the
effects of artificial light, in all the variable, most human, and yet most
factitious town landscape, I can only pity him, and go on my own way.</p>

<p>That is, if he will let me. But he tells me that one thing is right and the
other is wrong; that one is good art and the other is bad; and I listen in
amazement, sometimes not without impatience, wondering why an estimable personal
prejudice should be thus exalted into a dogma, and uttered in the name of art.
For in art there can be no prejudices, only results. If we arc to save people's
souls by the writing of verses, well and good. But if not, there is no choice
but to admit an absolute freedom of choice. And if Patchouli pleases one, why
not Patchouli?</p>

<p>AFTER SUNSET.</p>

<p>THE sea lies quieted beneath<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The after-sunset flush<br>
That leaves upon the heaped grey clouds<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The grape's faint purple blush.</p>

<p>Pale, from a little space in heaven<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of delicate ivory,<br>
The sickle-moon and one gold star<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Look down upon the sea.</p><a name="6"></a><br>
<br>
ON THE BEACH.

<p>NIGHT, a grey sky, a ghostly sea,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The soft beginning of the rain:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Black on the horizon, sails that wane<br>
Into the distance mistily.</p>

<p>The tide is rising, I can hear<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The soft roar broadening far along;<br>
It cries and murmurs in my car<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A sleepy old forgotten song.</p>

<p>Softly the stealthy night descends,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The black sails fade into the sky:<br>
Is this not, where the sea-line ends,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The shore-line of infinity?</p>

<p>I cannot think or dream: the grey<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unending waste of sea and night,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dull, impotently infinite,<br>
Blots out the very hope of day.</p><a name="7"></a><br>
<br>

<p>RAIN ON THE DOWN.</p>

<p>NIGHT, and the down by the sea,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And the veil of rain on the down;<br>
And she came through the mist and the rain to me<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From the safe warm lights of the town.</p>

<p>The rain shone in her hair,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And her face gleamed in the rain;<br>
And only the night and the rain were there<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As she came to me out of the rain.</p><a name="8"></a><br>
<br>

<p>BEFORE THE SQUALL.</p>

<p>THE wind is rising on the sea,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; White flashes dance along the deep,<br>
That moans as if uneasily<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It turned in an unquiet sleep.</p>

<p>Ridge after rocky ridge upheaves<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A toppling crest that falls in spray<br>
Where the tormented beach receives<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The buffets of the sea's wild play.</p>

<p>On the horizon's nearing line,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Where the sky rests, a visible wall.<br>
Grey in the offing, I divine<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The sails that fly before the squall.</p><a name="9"></a><br>
<br>

<p>UNDER THE CLIFFS.</p>

<p>BRIGHT light to windward on the horizon's verge;<br>
To leeward, stormy shadows, violet-black,<br>
And the wide sea between<br>
A vast unfurrowed field of windless green;<br>
The stormy shadows flicker on the track<br>
Of phantom sails that vanish and emerge.</p>

<p>I gaze across the sea, remembering her.<br>
I watch the white sun walk across the sea,<br>
This pallid afternoon,<br>
With feet that tread as whitely as the moon,<br>
And in his fleet and shining feet I see<br>
The footsteps of another voyager.</p><a name="10"></a><br>
<br>

<p>REQUIES.</p>

<p>O IS it death or life<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That sounds like something strangely known<br>
In this subsiding out of strife,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This slow sea-monotone?</p>

<p>A sound, scarce heard through sleep,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Murmurous as the August bees<br>
That fill the forest hollows deep<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; About the roots of trees.</p>

<p>O is it life or death,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; O is it hope or memory,<br>
That quiets all things with this breath<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of the eternal sea?</p><a name="12"></a><br>

<p>PASTEL.</p>

<p>THE light of our cigarettes<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Went and came in the gloom:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was dark in the little room.</p>

<p>Dark, and then, in the dark,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sudden, a flash, a glow,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And a hand and a ring I know.</p>

<p>And then, through the dark, a flush<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ruddy and vague, the grace<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A roseof her lyric face.</p><a name="14"></a><br>
<br>

<p>HER EYES.</p>

<p>BENEATH the heaven of her brows'<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unclouded noon of peace, there lies<br>
A leafy heaven of hazel boughs<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the seclusion of her eyes;</p>

<p>Her troubling eyes that cannot rest;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And there's a little flame that dances<br>
(A firefly in a grassy nest)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the green circle of her glances;</p>

<p>A frolic Faun that must be hid,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Shyly, in some fantastic shade,<br>
Where pity droops a tender lid<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On laughter of itself afraid.</p><a name="15"></a><br>

<p>MORBIDEZZA.</p>

<p>WHITE girl, your flesh is lilies<br>
Grown 'neath a frozen moon,<br>
So still is<br>
The rapture of your swoon<br>
Of whiteness, snow or lilies.</p>

<p>The virginal revealment,<br>
Your bosom's wavering slope,<br>
Concealment,<br>
'Neath fainting heliotrope,<br>
Of whitest white's revealment,</p>

<p>Is like a bed of lilies,<br>
A jealous-guarded row,<br>
Whose will is<br>
Simply chaste dreams:but oh,<br>
The alluring scent of lilies!</p><a name="16"></a><br>
<br>

<p>MAQUILLAGE.</p>

<p>THE charm of rouge on fragile cheeks,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pearl-powder, and, about the eyes,<br>
The dark and lustrous Eastern dyes;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The floating odour that bespeaks<br>
A scented boudoir and the doubtful night<br>
Of alcoves curtained close against the light</p>

<p>Gracile and creamy white and rose,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Complexioned like the flower of dawn,<br>
Her fleeting colours are as those<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That, from an April sky withdrawn,<br>
Fade in a fragrant mist of tears away<br>
When weeping noon leads on the altered day.</p><a name="17"></a><br>
<br>

<p>IMPRESSION.</p>

<p>TO M. C.</p>

<p>THE pink and black of silk and lace,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Flushed in the rosy-golden glow<br>
Of lamplight on her lifted face;<br>
Powder and wig, and pink and lace,</p>

<p>And those pathetic eyes of hers;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But all the London footlights know<br>
The little plaintive smile that stirs<br>
The shadow in those eyes of hers.</p>

<p>Outside, the dreary church-bell tolled,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The London Sunday faded slow;<br>
Ah, what is this? what wings unfold<br>
In this miraculous rose of gold?</p><a name="18"></a><br>
<br>

<p>AN ANGEL OF PERUGINO.</p>

<p>HAVE I not seen your face before<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Where Perugino's angels stand<br>
In those calm circles, and adore<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With singing throat and lifted hand?</p>

<p>So the pale hair lay crescent-wise,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; About the placid forehead curled,<br>
And the pale piety of eyes<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Was as God's peace upon the world.</p>

<p>And you, a simple child serene,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wander upon your quiet way,<br>
Nor know that any eyes have seen<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Umbrian halo crown the day.</p><a name="19"></a><br>
<br>

<p>AT FONTAINEBLEAU.</p>

<p>IT was a day of sun and rain,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Uncertain as a child's quick moods;<br>
And I shall never pass again<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So blithe a day among the woods.</p>

<p>The forest knew you and was glad,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And laughed for very joy to know<br>
Her child was with her; then, grown sad,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She wept, because her child must go.</p>

<p>And you would spy and you would capture<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The shyest flower that lit the grass:<br>
The joy I had to watch your rapture<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Was keen as even your rapture was.</p>

<p>The forest knew you and was glad,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And laughed and wept for joy and woe.<br>
This was the welcome that you had<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Among the woods of Fontainebleau.</p><a name="20"></a><br>
<br>

<p>ON THE HEATH.</p>

<p>HER face's wilful flash and glow<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Turned all its light upon my face<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One bright delirious moment's space,<br>
And then she passed: I followed slow</p>

<p>Across the heath, and up and round,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And watched the splendid death of day<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Upon the summits far away,<br>
And in her fateful beauty found</p>

<p>The fierce wild beauty of the light<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That startles twilight on the hills,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And lightens all the mountain rills,<br>
And flames before the feet of night.</p><a name="21"></a><br>
<br>

<p>IN THE ORATORY.</p>

<p>THE incense mounted like a cloud,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A golden cloud of languid scent;<br>
Robed priests before the altar bowed,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Expecting the divine event.</p>

<p>Then silence, like a prisoner bound,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rose, by a mighty hand set free,<br>
And dazzlingly, in shafts of sound,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thundered Beethoven's Mass in C.</p>

<p>She knelt in prayer; large lids serene<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lay heavy on the sombre eyes,<br>
As though to veil some vision seen<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Upon the mounts of Paradise.</p>

<p>Her dark face, calm as carven stone.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The face that twilight shows the day,<br>
Brooded, mysteriously alone,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And infinitely far away.</p>

<p>Inexplicable eyes that drew<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mine eyes adoring, why from me<br>
Demand, new Sphinx, the fatal clue<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That seals my doom or conquers thee?</p><a name="22"></a><br>
<br>

<p>PATTIE.</p>

<p>COOL comely country Pattie, grown<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A daisy where the daisies grow,<br>
No wind of heaven has ever blown<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Across a field-flower's daintier snow.</p>

<p>Gold-white among the meadow-grass<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The humble little daisies thrive;<br>
I cannot see them as I pass,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But I am glad to be alive.</p>

<p>And so I turn where Pattie stands,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A flower among the flowers at play;<br>
I'll lay my heart into her hands,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And she will smile the clouds away.</p><a name="23"></a><br>
<br>

<p>IN AN OMNIBUS.</p>

<p>YOUR smile is like a treachery,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A treachery adorable;<br>
So smiles the siren where the sea<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sings to the unforgetting shell.</p>

<p>Your fleeting Leonardo face,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Parisian Monna Lisa, dreams<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Elusively, but not of streams<br>
Born in a shadow-haunted place.</p>

<p>Of Paris, Paris, is your thought,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of Paris robes, and when to wear<br>
The latest bonnet you have bought<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To match the marvel of your hair.</p>

<p>Yet that fine malice of your smile,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That faint and fluctuating glint<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Between your eyelids, does it hint<br>
Alone of matters mercantile?</p>

<p>Close lips that keep the secret in,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Half spoken by the stealthy eyes,<br>
Is there indeed no word to win,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No secret, from the vague replies</p>

<p>Of lips and lids that feign to hide<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That which they feign to render up?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is there, in Tantalus' dim cup,<br>
The shadow of water, nought beside?</p><a name="24"></a><br>
<br>

<p>ON MEETING AFTER.</p>

<p>HER eyes are haunted, eyes that were<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Scarce sad when last we met.<br>
What thing is this has come to her<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That she may not forget?</p>

<p>They loved, they married: it is well!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But ah, what memories<br>
Are these whereof her eyes half tell,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her haunted eyes?</p><a name="25"></a><br>
<br>

<p>IN BOHEMIA.</p>

<p>DRAWN blinds and flaring gas within,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And wine, and women, and cigars;<br>
Without, the city's heedless din;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Above, the white unheeding stars.</p>

<p>And we, alike from each remote,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The world that works, the heaven that waits,<br>
Con our brief pleasures o'er by rote,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The favourite pastime of the Fates.</p>

<p>We smoke, to fancy that we dream,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And drink, a moment's joy to prove,<br>
And fain would love, and only seem<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To love because we cannot love.</p>

<p>Draw back the blinds, put out the light:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Tis morning, let the daylight come.<br>
God! how the women's checks are white,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And how the sunlight strikes us dumb!</p><a name="26"></a><br>

<p>EMMY.</p>

<p>EMMY'S exquisite youth and her virginal air,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Eyes and teeth in the flash of a musical smile,<br>
Come to me out of the past, and I see her there<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As I saw her once for a while.</p>

<p>Emmy's laughter rings in my ears, as bright,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fresh and sweet as the voice of a mountain brook,<br>
And still I hear her telling us tales that night,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Out of Boccaccio's book.</p>

<p>There, in the midst of the villainous dancing-hall,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Leaning across the table, over the beer,<br>
While the music maddened the whirling skirts of the ball,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As the midnight hour drew near,</p>

<p>There with the women, haggard, painted and old,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One fresh bud in a garland withered and stale,<br>
She, with her innocent voice and her clear eyes, told<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tale after shameless tale.</p>

<p>And ever the witching smile, to her face beguiled,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Paused and broadened, and broke in a ripple of fun,<br>
And the soul of a child looked out of the eyes of a child,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Or ever the tale was done.</p>

<p>O my child, who wronged you first, and began<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First the dance of death that you dance so well?<br>
Soul for soul: and I think the soul of a man<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Shall answer for yours in hell.</p><a name="27"></a><br>
<br>

<p>EMMY AT THE ELDORADO.</p>

<p>TO meet, of all unlikely things,<br>
Here, after all one's wanderings!<br>
But, Emmy, though we meet,<br>
What of this lover at your feet?</p>

<p>For, is this Emmy that I see?<br>
A fragile domesticity<br>
I seem to half surprise<br>
In the evasions of those eyes.</p>

<p>Once a child's cloudless eyes, they seem<br>
Lost in the blue depths of a dream,<br>
As though, for innocent hours,<br>
To stray with love among the flowers.</p>

<p>Without regret, without desire,<br>
In those old days of love on hire,<br>
Child, child, what will you do,<br>
Emmy, now love is come to you?</p>

<p>Already, in so brief a while,<br>
The gleam has faded from your smile;<br>
This grave and tender air<br>
Leaves you, for all but one, less fair.</p>

<p>Then, you were heedless, happy, gay,<br>
Immortally a child; to-day<br>
A woman, at the years' control:<br>
Undine has found a soul.</p><a name="28"></a><br>
<br>

<p>AT THE CAVOUR.</p>

<p>WINE, the red coals, the flaring gas,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bring out a brighter tone in cheeks<br>
That learn at home before the glass<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The flush that eloquently speaks.</p>

<p>The blue-grey smoke of cigarettes<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Curls from the lessening ends that glow;<br>
The men are thinking of the bets,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The women of the debts, they owe.</p>

<p>Then their eyes meet, and in their eyes<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The accustomed smile comes up to call,<br>
A look half miserably wise.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Half heedlessly ironical.</p><a name="29"></a><br>
<br>

<p>IN THE HAYMARKET.</p>

<p>I DANCED at your ball a year ago,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To-night I pay for your bread and cheese,<br>
&quot;And a glass of bitters, if you please,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For you drank my best champagne, you know!&quot;</p>

<p>Madcap ever, you laugh the while,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As you drink your bitters and munch your bread;<br>
The face is the same, and the same old smile<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Came up at a word I said.</p>

<p>A year ago I danced at your ball,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I sit by your side in the bar to-night;<br>
And the luck has changed, you say: that's all!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And the luck will change, you say: all right!</p>

<p>For the men go by, and the rent's to pay,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And you haven't a friend in the world to-day;<br>
And the money comes and the money goes:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And to-night, who cares? and to-morrow, who knows?</p><a name=

<p>HER eyes are brands that keep the angry heat<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of fire that crawls and leaves an ashen<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The dust of this devouring flame she hath<br>
Upon her cheeks and eyelids. Fresh and sweet<br>
In days that were, her sultry beauty now<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is pain transfigured, love's impenitence,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The memory of a maiden innocence,<br>
As a crown set upon a weary brow.</p>

<p>She sits, and fain would listen, fain forget;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She smiles, but with those tragic, waiting eyes,<br>
Those proud and piteous lips that hunger yet<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For love's fulfilment. Ah, when Landry cries<br>
&quot;My heart is dead!&quot; with what a wild regret<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her own heart feels the throb that never dies!</p><a name=

<p>THE BLIND BEGGAR.</p>

<p>HE stands, a patient figure, where the crowd<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Heaves to and fro beside him. In his ears<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All day the Fair goes thundering, and he hears<br>
In darkness, as a dead man in his shroud.<br>
Patient he stands, with age and sorrow bowed,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And holds a piteous hat of ancient yean;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And in his face and gesture there appears<br>
The desperate humbleness of poor men proud.</p>

<p>What thoughts are his, as, with the inward sight,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He sees those mirthful faces pass him by?<br>
Is the long darkness darker for that light.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The misery deeper when that joy is nigh?<br>
Patient, alone, he stands from morn to night,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pleading in his reproachful misery.</p><a name="32"></a><br>
<br>

<p>THE OLD LABOURER.</p>

<p>HIS fourscore years have bent a back of oak,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His earth-brown cheeks are full of hollow pits;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His gnarled hands wander idly as he sits<br>
Bending above the hearthstone's feeble smoke.<br>
Threescore and ten slow years he tilled the land;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He wrung his bread from out the stubborn soil;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He saw his masters flourish through his toil;<br>
He held their substance in his horny hand.</p>

<p>Now he is old: he asks for daily bread:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He who has sowed the bread he may not taste<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Begs for the crumbs: he
would do no man wrong.<br>
The Parish Guardians, when his case is read,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Will grant him (yet with no unseemly haste)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just seventeen pence to starve on, seven days long.</p><a name=

<p>GENTLY I wave the visible world away.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Far off, I hear a roar, afar yet near,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Far off and strange, a voice is in my ear,<br>
And is the voice my own? the words I say<br>
Fall strangely, like a dream, across the day;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And the dim sunshine is a dream. How clear,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; New as the world to lovers' eyes, appear<br>
The men and women passing on their way!</p>

<p>The world is very fair. The hours are all<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Linked in a dance of mere forgetfulness.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am at peace with God
and man. O glide,<br>
Sands of the hour-glass that I count not, fall<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Serenely: scarce I feel your soft caress.<br>

indifferent tide.</p><a name="34"></a><br>

<p>JAVANESE DANCERS,</p>

<p>TWITCHED strings, the clang of metal, beaten drums.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dull, shrill, continuous, disquieting;<br>
And now the stealthy dancer comes<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Undulantly with cat-like steps that cling;</p>

<p>Smiling between her painted lids a smile,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Motionless, unintelligible, she twines<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her fingers into mazy lines,<br>
Twining her scarves across them all the while.</p>

<p>One, two, three, four step forth, and, to and fro,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Delicately and imperceptibly,<br>
Now swaying gently in a row,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now interthreading slow and rhythmically,</p>

<p>Still with fixed eyes, monotonously still,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mysteriously, with smiles inanimate,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With lingering feet that undulate,<br>
With sinuous fingers, spectral hands that thrill,</p>

<p>The little amber-coloured dancers move,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Like little painted figures on a screen,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Or phantom-dancers haply seen<br>
Among the shadows of a magic grove.</p><a name="35"></a><br>

<p>LOVE IN SPRING.</p>

<p>GOOD to be loved and to love for a little, and then<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Well to forget, be forgotten, ere loving grow life!<br>
Dear, you have loved me, but was I the man among men?<br>
Sweet, I have loved you, but scarcely as mistress or wife.</p>

<p>Message of Spring in the hearts of a man and a maid,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hearts on a holiday: ho! let us love: it is Spring.<br>
Joy in the birds of the air, in the buds of the glade,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Joy in our hearts in the joy of the hours on the wing.</p>

<p>Well, but to-morrow? To-morrow, good-bye: it is over.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Scarcely with tears shall we part, with a smile who had
met.<br>
Tears? What is this? But I thought we were playing at lover.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Play-time is past. I am going. And you love me yet!</p><a name=

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Over our heads the April blossom;<br>
April-hearted are we.</p>

<p>Under the pink and white,<br>
Love in her eyes alight;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Love and the Spring and Kensington Gardens:<br>
Hey for the heart's delight!</p><a name="39"></a><br>
<br>

<p>REWARDS.</p>

<p>BECAUSE you cried, I kissed you, and,<br>
Ah me! how should I understand<br>
That piteous little you were fain<br>
To cry and to be kissed again?</p>

<p>Because you smiled at last, I thought<br>
That I had found what I had sought.<br>
But soon I found, without a doubt,<br>
No man can find a woman out.</p>

<p>I kissed your tears, and did not stay<br>
Till I had kissed them all away.<br>
Ah, hapless me! ah, heartless child!<br>
She would not kiss me when she smiled.</p><a name="40"></a><br>
<br>

<p>PERFUME.</p>

<p>SHAKE out your hair about me, so,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That I may feel the stir and scent<br>
Of those vague odours come and go<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The way our kisses went.</p>

<p>Night gave this priceless hour of love,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But now the dawn steals in apace,<br>
And amorously bends above<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The wonder of your face.</p>

<p>&quot;Farewell&quot; between our kisses creeps,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You fade, a ghost, upon the air;<br>
Yet, ah! the vacant place still keeps<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The odour of your hair.</p><a name="41"></a><br>
<br>

<p>SOUVENIR.</p>

<p>HOW you haunt me with your eyes!<br>
Still that questioning persistence,<br>
Sad and sweet, across the distance<br>
Of the days of love and laughter,<br>
Those old days of love and lies.</p>

<p>Not reproaching, not reproving,<br>
Only, always, questioning,<br>
Those divinest eyes can bring<br>
Memories of certain summers,<br>
Nights of dreaming, days of loving,</p>

<p>When I loved you, when your kiss,<br>
Shyer than a bird to capture,<br>
Lit a sudden heaven of rapture;<br>
When we neither dreamt that either<br>
Could grow old in heart like this.</p>

<p>Do you still, in love's December,<br>
Still remember, still regret<br>
That sweet unavailing debt?<br>
Ah, you haunt me, to remind me<br>
You remember, I forget!</p><a name="42"></a><br>
<br>

<p>TO MARY.</p>

<p>IF, Mary, that imperious face,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And not in dreams alone,<br>
Come to this shadow-haunted place<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And claim dominion;</p>

<p>If, for your sake, I do unqueen<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some well-remembered ghost,<br>
Forgetting much of what hath been<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Best loved, remembered most;</p>

<p>It is your witchery, not my will,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Your beauty, not my choice:<br>
My shadows knew me faithful, till<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They heard your living voice.</p><a name="43"></a><br>
<br>

<p>TO A GREAT ACTRESS.</p>

<p>SHE has taken my heart, though she knows not, would care not.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It thrills at her voice like a reed in the wind;<br>
I would taste all her agonies, have her to spare not,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sin deep as she sinned,</p>

<p>To be tossed by the storm of her love, as the ocean<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rocks vessels to wreck; to be hers, though the cost<br>
Were the loss of all else: for that moment's emotion<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Content to be lost!</p>

<p>To be, for a moment, the man of all men to her,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All the world, for one measureless moment complete;<br>
To possess, be possessed! To be mockery then to her,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then to die at her feet!</p><a name="44"></a><br>
<br>

<p>LOVE IN DREAMS.</p>

<p>I LIE on my pallet bed,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And I hear the drip of the rain;<br>
The rain on my garret roof is falling,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And I am cold and in pain.</p>

<p>I lie on my pallet bed,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And my heart is wild with delight;<br>
I hear her voice through the midnight calling,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As I lie awake in the night.</p>

<p>I lie on my pallet bed,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And I see her bright eyes gleam;<br>
She smiles, she speaks, and the world is ended,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And made again in a dream.</p><a name="45"></a><br>

<p>MUSIC AND MEMORY.</p>

<p>To K.W.</p>

<p>ACROSS the tides of music, in the night,<br>
Her magical face,<br>
A light upon it as the happy light<br>
Of dreams in some delicious place<br>
Under the moonlight in the night.</p>

<p>Music, soft throbbing music in the night,<br>
Her memory swims<br>
Into the brain, a carol of delight;<br>
The cup of music overbrims<br>
With wine of memory, in the night.</p>

<p>Her face across the music, in the night,<br>
Her face a refrain,<br>
A light that sings along the waves of light,<br>
A memory that returns again,<br>
Music in music, in the night.</p><a name="46"></a><br>

<p>SPRING TWILIGHT.</p>

<p>To K. W.</p>

<p>THE twilight droops across the day,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I watch her portrait on the wall<br>
Palely recede into the grey<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That palely comes and covers all.</p>

<p>The sad Spring twilight, dull, forlorn,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The menace of the dreary night:<br>
But in her face, more fair than morn,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A sweet suspension of delight.</p><a name="47"></a><br>
<br>

<p>IN WINTER.</p>

<p>PALE from the watery west, with the pallor of winter a-cold,<br>
Rays of the afternoon sun in a glimmer across the trees;<br>
Glittering moist underfoot, the long alley. The firs, one by one,<br>
Catch and conceal, as I saunter, and flash in a dazzle of gold<br>
Lower and lower the vanishing disc: and the sun alone sees<br>
At I wait for my love in the fir-tree alley alone with the sun.</p><a name=

<p>QUEST.</p>

<p>I CHASE a shadow through the night,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A shadow unavailing;<br>
Out of the dark, into the light,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I follow, follow: is it she?</p>

<p>Against the wall of sea outlined,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Outlined against the windows lit,<br>
The shadow flickers, and behind<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I follow, follow after it.</p>

<p>The shadow leads me through the night<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To the grey margin of the sea;<br>
Out of the dark, into the light,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I follow unavailingly.</p><a name="49"></a><br>

<p>TO A PORTRAIT.</p>

<p>A PENSIVE photograph<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Watches me from the shelf:<br>
Ghost of old love, and half<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ghost of myself!</p>

<p>How the dear waiting eyes<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Watch me and love me yet:<br>
Sad home of memories,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her waiting eyes!</p>

<p>Ghost of old love, wronged ghost,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Return, though all the pain<br>
Of all once loved, long lost,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Come back again.</p>

<p>Forget not, but forgive!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Alas, too late I cry.<br>
We are two ghosts that had their chance to live,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And lost it, she and I.</p><a name="50"></a><br>

<p>SECOND THOUGHTS.</p>

<p>WHEN you were here, ah foolish then!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I scarcely knew I loved you, dear.<br>
I know it now, I know it when<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You are no longer here.</p>

<p>When you were here, I sometimes tired,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ah me! that you so loved me, dear.<br>
Now, in these weary days desired,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You are no longer here.</p>

<p>When you were here, did either know<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That each so loved the other, dear?<br>
But that was long and long ago:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You are no longer here.</p><a name="51"></a><br>

<p>APRIL MIDNIGHT.</p>

<p>SIDE by side through the streets at midnight,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Roaming together,<br>
Through the tumultuous night of London,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the miraculous April weather.</p>

<p>Roaming together under the gaslight,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Day's work over,<br>
How the Spring calls to us, here in the city,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Calls to the heart from the heart of a lover!</p>

<p>Cool the wind blows, fresh in our facet,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cleansing, entrancing,<br>
After the heat and the fumes and the footlights,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Where you dance and I watch your dancing.</p>

<p>Good it is to be here together,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Good to be roaming;<br>
Even in London, even at midnight,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lover-like in a lover's gloaming.</p>

<p>You the dancer and I the dreamer,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Children together,<br>
Wandering lost in the night of London,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the miraculous April weather.</p><a name="52"></a><br>
<br>

<p>DURING MUSIC.</p>

<p>THE music had the heat of blood,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A passion that no words can reach;<br>
We sat together, and understood<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our own heart's speech.</p>

<p>We had no need of word or sign,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The music spoke for us, and said<br>
All that her eyes could read in mine<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Or mine in hers had read.</p><a name="53"></a><br>
<br>

<p>ON THE BRIDGE.</p>

<p>MIDNIGHT falls across hollow gulfs of<br>
night<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As a stone that falls in a sounding well;<br>
Under us the Seine flows through dark and light,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While the beat of timehark!is audible.</p>

<p>Lights on bank and bridge glitter gold and red,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lights upon the stream glitter red and white;<br>
Under us the night, and the night overhead.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We together, we alone together in the night.</p><a name=

<br>

<p>&quot;I DREAM OF HER.&quot;</p>

<p>I DREAM of her the whole night long,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The pillows with my tears are wet.<br>
I wake, I seek amid the throng<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The courage to forget.</p>

<p>Yet still, as night comes round, I dread,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With unavailing fears,<br>
The dawn that finds, beneath my head,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The pillows wet with tears.</p><a name="55"></a><br>
<br>

<p>TEARS.</p>

<p>O HANDS that I have held in mine,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That knew my kisses and my tears,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hands that in other years<br>
Have poured my balm, have poured my wine;</p>

<p>Women, once loved, and always mine,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I call to you across the years,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I bring a gift of tears,<br>
I bring my tears to you as wine.</p><a name="56"></a><br>
<br>

<p>THE LAST EXIT.</p>

<p>OUR love was all arrayed in pleasantness,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A tender little love that sighed and smiled<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At little happy nothings, like a child,<br>
A dainty little love in fancy dress.</p>

<p>But now the love that once was half in play<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Has come to be this grave and piteous thing.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Why did you leave me all this suffering<br>
For all your memory when you went away?</p>

<p>You might have played the play out, O my friend,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Closing upon a kiss our comedy.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Or is it, then, a fault of taste in me,<br>
Who like no tragic exit at the end?</p><a name="57"></a><br>
<br>

<p>AFTER LOVE.</p>

<p>O TO part now, and, parting now,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Never to meet again;<br>
To have done for ever, I and thou,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With joy, and so with pain.</p>

<p>It is too hard, too hard to meet<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As friends, and love no more;<br>
Those other meetings were too sweet<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That went before.</p>

<p>And I would have, now love it over,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; An end to all, an end:<br>
I cannot, having been your lover,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Stoop to become your friend!</p><a name="58"></a><br>
<br>

<p>ALLA PASSERETTA BRUNA.</p>

<p>IF I bid you, you will come,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If I bid you, you will go,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You are mine, and so I
take you<br>
To my heart, your home;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Well, ah, well I know<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I shall not forsake you.</p>

<p>I shall always hold you fast,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I shall never set you free,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You are mine, and I
possess you<br>
Long as life shall last;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You will comfort me,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I shall bless you.</p>

<p>I shall keep you as we keep<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Flowers for memory, hid away,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Under many a newer token<br>
Buried deep,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Roses of a gaudier day,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rings and trinkets,
bright and broken.</p>

<p>Other women I shall love,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fame and fortune I may win,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But when fame and love
forsake me<br>
And the light is night above,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You will let me in,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You will take me.</p><a name=

<p>NOCTURNES.</p><a name="60"></a><br>
<br>

<p>NOCTURNE.</p>

<p>ONE little cab to hold us two,<br>
Night, an invisible dome of cloud,<br>
The rattling wheels that made our whispers loud,<br>
As heart-beats into whispers grew;<br>
And, long, the Embankment with its lights,<br>
The pavement glittering with fallen rain,<br>
The magic and the mystery that are night's,<br>
And human love without the pain.</p>

<p>The river shook with wavering gleams,<br>
Deep buried as the glooms that lay<br>
Impenetrable as the grave of day,<br>
Near and as distant as our dreams.<br>
A bright train flashed with all its squares<br>
Of warm light where the bridge lay mistily.<br>
The night was all about us: we were free,<br>
Free of the day and all its cares!</p>

<p>That was an hour of bliss too long,<br>
Too long to last where joy is brief.<br>
Yet one escape of souls may yield relief<br>
To many weary seasons' wrong.<br>
&quot;O last for ever!&quot; my heart cried;<br>
It ended: heaven was done.<br>
I had been dreaming by her side<br>
That heaven was but begun.</p><a name="61"></a><br>
<br>

<p>HER STREET.</p>

<p>(IN ABSENCE.)</p>

<p>I PASSED your street of many memories.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A sunset, sombre pink, the flush<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of inner rose-leaves idle fingers crush,<br>
Died softly, as the rose that dies.<br>
All the high heaven behind the roof lay thus,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tenderly dying, touched with pain<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A little; standing there I saw again<br>
The sunsets that were dear to us.</p>

<p>I knew not if 'twere bitter or more sweet<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To stand and watch the roofs, the sky.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; O bitter to be there and you not nigh,<br>
Yet this had been that blessed street.<br>
How the name thrilled me, there upon the wall!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There was the house, the windows there<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Against the rosy twilight high and bare,<br>
The pavement-stones: I knew them all!</p>

<p>Days that have been, days that have fallen cold!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I stood and gazed, and thought of you,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Until remembrance sweet and mournful drew<br>
Tears to eyes smiling as of old.<br>
So, sad and glad, your memory visibly<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Alive within my eyes, I turned;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And, through a window, met two eyes that burned,<br>
Tenderly questioning, on me.</p><a name="62"></a><br>

<p>ON JUDGES' WALK.</p>

<p>THAT night on Judges' Walk the wind<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Was as the voice of doom;<br>
The heath, a lake of darkness, lay<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As silent as the tomb.</p>

<p>The vast night brooded, white with stars,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Above the world's unrest;<br>
The awfulness of silence ached<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Like a strong heart repressed.</p>

<p>That night we walked beneath the trees,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Alone, beneath the trees;<br>
There was some word we could not say<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Half uttered in the breeze.</p>

<p>That night on Judges' Walk we said<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No word of all we had to say;<br>
But now there shall be no word said<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Before the Judge's Day.</p><a name="63"></a><br>
<br>

<p>IN THE NIGHT.</p>

<p>THE moonlight had tangled the trees<br>
Under our feet as we walked in the night,<br>
And the shadows beneath us were stirred by the breeze<br>
In the magical light;<br>
And the moon was a silver fire,<br>
And the stars were flickers of flame,<br>
Golden and violet and red;<br>
And the night-wind sighed my desire,<br>
And the wind in the tree-tops whispered and said<br>
In her ear her adorable name.</p>

<p>But her heart would not hear what I heard,<br>
The pulse of the night as it beat,<br>
Love, Love, Love, the unspeakable word,<br>
In its murmurous repeat;<br>
She heard not the night-wind's sigh,<br>
Nor her own name breathed in her ear,<br>
Nor the cry of my heart to her heart,<br>
A speechless, a clamorous cry:<br>
&quot;Love! Love! will she hear? will she hear?&quot;<br>
O heart, she will hear, by and by,<br>
When we part, when for ever we part.</p><a name="64"></a><br>

<p>AS in the age of shepherd king and queen,<br>
Painted and frail amid her nodding bows,<br>
Under the sombre branches, and between<br>
The green and mossy garden-ways she goes,<br>
With little mincing airs one keeps to pet<br>
A darling and provoking perroquet.<br>
Her long-trained robe is blue, the fan she holds<br>
With fluent fingers girt with heavy rings,<br>
So vaguely hints of vague erotic things<br>
That her eye smiles, musing among its folds.<br>
Blonde too, a tiny nose, a rosy mouth,<br>
Artful as that sly patch that makes more sly,<br>
In her divine unconscious pride of youth,<br>
The slightly simpering sparkle of the eye.</p><a name="67"></a><br>

<p>True to the promise her eyes gave,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A dainty fever through my veins;</p>

Tircis beside his Dorim<font face="Times New Roman">è</font>ne,<br>

<p>That blackguard of a Harlequin<br>
Pirouettes, and plots to win<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His Colombine that flits and flies.</p>

<p>Colombine dreams, and starts to find<br>
A sad heart sighing in the wind,<br>

<p>THE wind the other evening overthrew<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The little Love who smiled so mockingly<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Down that mysterious alley, so that we,<br>
Remembering, mused thereon a whole day through.</p>

<p>The wind has overthrown him! The poor stone<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lies scattered to the breezes. It is sad<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To see the lonely pedestal, that had<br>
The artist's name, scarce visible, alone,</p>

<p>Oh! it is sad to see the pedestal<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Left lonely! and in dream I seem to hear<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Prophetic voices whisper in my ear<br>
The lonely and despairing end of all.</p>

<p>Oh! it is sad! And thou, hast thou not found<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One heart-throb for the pity, though thine eye<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lights at the gold and purple butterfly<br>
Brightening the littered leaves upon the ground.</p><a name="72"></a><br>

<p>MYSTICAL strains unheard,<br>
A song without a word,<br>
Dearest, because thine eyes.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pale as the skies,</p>

<p>Because thy voice, remote<br>
As the far clouds that float<br>
Veiling for me the whole<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Heaven of the soul,</p>

<p>Because the stately scent<br>
Of thy swan's whiteness, blent<br>
With the white lily's bloom<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of thy perfume,</p>

The music breathed above<br>
By angels halo-crowned,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Odour and sound,</p>

<p>TEARS in my heart that weeps,<br>
Like the rain upon the town,<br>
What drowsy languor steeps<br>
In tears my heart that weeps?</p>

<p>O sweet sound of the rain<br>
On earth and on the roofs!<br>
For a heart's weary pain<br>
O the song of the rain!</p>

<p>Vain tears, vain tears, my heart!<br>
What, none hath done thee wrong?<br>
Tears without reason start,<br>
From my disheartened heart.</p>

<p>This is the weariest woe,<br>
O heart, of love and hate<br>
Too weary, not to know<br>
Why thou hast all this woe.</p><a name="74"></a><br>

<p>CITY NIGHTS.</p>

<p>I. IN THE TRAIN.</p>

<p>THE train through the night of the town,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Through a blackness broken in twain<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By the sudden finger of
streets;<br>
Lights, red, yellow, and brown,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From curtain and window-pane,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The flashing eyes of the
streets.</p>

<p>Night, and the rush of the train,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A cloud of smoke through the town,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Scaring the life of the
streets;<br>
And the leap of the heart again,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Out into the night, and down<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The dazzling vista of
streets!</p>

<p>II. IN THE TEMPLE.</p>

<p>THE grey and misty night,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Slim trees that hold the night among<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Their branches, and, along<br>
The vague Embankment, light on light.</p>

<p>The sudden, racing lights!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I can just hear, distinct, aloof,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The gaily clattering hoof<br>
Beating the rhythm of festive nights.</p>

<p>The gardens to the weeping moon<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sigh back the breath of tears.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; O the refrain of years on years<br>
'Neath the weeping moon!</p><a name="76"></a><br>
<br>

<p>A WHITE NIGHT.</p>

<p>THE yellow moon across the clouds<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That shiver in the sky;<br>
White, hurrying travellers, the clouds,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And, white and aching cold on high,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Stars in the sky.</p>

<p>Whiter, along the frozen earth,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The miracle of snow;<br>
Close covered as for sleep, the earth<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lies, mutely slumbering below<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Its shroud of snow.</p>

<p>Sleepless I wander in the night,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And, wandering, watch for day;<br>
Earth sleeps, yet, high in heaven, the night<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Awakens, faint and far away,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A phantom day.</p><a name="77"></a><br>
<br>

<p>IN THE VALLEY.</p>

<p>DOWN the valley will I wander, singing songs forlorn,<br>
Waiting for the maiden coming up between the corn.</p>

<p>Down below I hear the river babbling to the breeze,<br>
And I see the sunlight kiss the tresses of the trees.</p>

<p>All the corn is shining with the tears of early rain:<br>
Come, thou sunlight of mine eyes, and bring the dawn again!</p>

<p>Down the valley will I wander, singing songs forlorn,<br>
Till I meet the maiden coming up between the corn.</p><a name="78"></a><br>
<br>

<p>PEACE AT NOON.</p>

<p>HERE there is peace, cool peace,<br>
Upon these heights, beneath these trees;<br>
Almost the peace of sleep or death,<br>
To wearying brain, to labouring breath.</p>

<p>Here there is rest at last,<br>
A sweet forgetting of the past;<br>
There is no future here, nor aught<br>
Save this soft healing pause of thought.</p><a name="79"></a><br>
<br>

<p>IN FOUNTAIN COURT.</p>

<p>THE fountain murmuring of sleep,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A drowsy tune;<br>
The flickering green of leaves that keep<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The light of June;<br>
Peace, through a slumbering afternoon,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The peace of June.</p>

<p>A waiting ghost, in the blue sky,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The white curved moon;<br>
June, hushed and breathless, waits, and I<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wait too, with June;<br>
Come, through the lingering afternoon,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Soon, love, come soon.</p><a name="80"></a><br>
<br>

<p>AT BURGOS.</p>

<p>MIRACULOUS silver-work in stone<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Against the blue miraculous skies,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The belfry towers and turrets rise<br>
Out of the arches that enthrone<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That airy wonder of the skies.</p>

<p>Softly against the burning sun<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The great cathedral spreads its wings;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; High up, the lyric belfry sings.<br>
Behold Ascension Day begun<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Under the shadow of those wings!</p><a name="81"></a><br>
<br>

<p>AT DAWN.</p>

<p>SHE only knew the birth and death<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of days, when each that died<br>
Was still at mom a hope, at night<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A hope unsatisfied.</p>

<p>The dark trees shivered to behold<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another day begin;<br>
She, being hopeless, did not weep<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As the grey dawn came in.</p><a name="82"></a><br>
<br>

<p>IN AUTUMN.</p>

<p>FRAIL autumn lights upon the leaves<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Beacon the ending of the year.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The windy rains are here,<br>
Wet nights and blowing winds about the eaves.</p>

<p>Here in the valley, mists begin<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To breathe about the river side<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The breath of autumn-tide.<br>
The dark fields wait to take the harvest in.</p>

<p>And you, and you are far away.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ah, this it is, and not the rain<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now loud against the pane,<br>
That takes the light and colour from the day!</p><a name="83"></a><br>
<br>

<p>ON THE ROADS.</p>

<p>THE road winds onward long and white,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It curves in mazy coils, and crooks<br>
A beckoning finger down the height;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It calls me with the voice of brooks<br>
To thirsty travellers in the night.</p>

<p>I leave the lonely city street,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The awful silence of the crowd;<br>
The rhythm of the roads I beat,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My blood leaps up, I shout aloud,<br>
My heart keeps measure with my feet.</p>

<p>Nought know, nought care I whither I wend:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Tis on, on, on, or here or there.<br>
What profiteth it an aim or end?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I walk, and the road leads anywhere.<br>
Then forward, with the Fates to friend!</p>

<p>'Tis on and on! Who knows but thus<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Kind Chance shall bring us luck at last?<i><br></i>
Adventures to the adventurous!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hope flies before, and the hours slip past:<br>
O what have the hours in store for us?</p>

<p>A bird sings something in my ear,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The wind sings in my blood a song<br>
Tis good at times for a man to hear;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The road winds onward white and long,<br>
And the best of Earth is here!</p><a name="84"></a><br>
<br>

<p>PIERROT IN HALF-MOURNING.</p>

<p>I THAT am Pierrot, pray you pity me!<br>
To be so young, so old in misery:<br>
See me, and how the winter of my grief<br>
Wastes me, and how I whiten like a leaf,<br>
And how, like a lost child, lost and afraid,<br>
I seek the shadow, I that am a shade,<br>
I that have loved a moonbeam, nor have won<br>
Any Diana to Endymion.<br>
Pity me, for I have but loved too well<br>
The hope of the too fair impossible.<br>
Ah, it is she, she, Columbine: again<br>
I see her, and I woo her, and in vain.<br>
She lures me with her beckoning finger-tip;<br>
How her eyes shine for me, and how her lips<br>
Bloom for me, roses, roses, red and rich!<br>
She waves to me the white arms of a witch<br>
Over the world: I follow, I forget<br>
All, but she'll love me yet, she'll love me yet!</p><a name="85"></a><br>
<br>

<p>FOR A PICTURE OF WATTEAU.</p>

<p>HERE the vague winds have rest;<br>
The forest breathes in sleep,<br>
Lifting a quiet breast;<br>
It is the hour of rest.</p>

<p>How summer glides away!<br>
An autumn pallor blooms<br>
Upon the check of day.<br>
Come, lovers, come away!</p>

<p>But here, where dead leaves fall<br>
Upon the grass, what strains,<br>
Languidly musical,<br>
Mournfully rise and fall?</p>

<p>Light loves that woke with spring<br>
This autumn afternoon<br>
Beholds meandering,<br>
Still, to the strains of spring.</p>

<p>Your dancing feet are faint,<br>
Lovers: the air recedes<br>
Into a sighing plaint,<br>
Faint, as your loves are faint.</p>

<p>It is the end, the end,<br>
The dance of love's decease.<br>
Feign no more now, fair friend!<br>
It is the end, the end.</p><br>

works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
